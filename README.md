# Movie Success Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
In recent years, predictive analysis using Machine Learning algorithms is getting more traction with the emergence of newer prediction techniques. One of the areas where it can be used is in predicting box office revenue for upcoming movies. For our analysis, we gathered data from the popular online movie database website, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Rotten Tomatoes, and Kaggle. We focused on two types of problems, *classification* and *regression*. For classification, we used three algorithms to classify if a movie will be successful in the box office or not. Then we used regression to analyze how successful each movie will be by predicting the total revenue. When we tried to build our model, we selected multiple features based on *pearson correlation coefficient* values and used them to predict box office revenue.
